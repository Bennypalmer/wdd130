    <h2> Benson Palmer</h2>
    <p> My name is Benson Palmer, I am from Gilbert Arizona originally,
        but move to the Dallas Texas, area when I was younger.
        I love to play basketball, video games, spend time with my girlfriend,
        and absolutely love to travel.</p>
    <p> I am not married yet, but I am planning on propsoing to 
        my girlfriend within the next month or two. The degree I am pursuing
        is Web Design and Development. I really enjoy the programming aspect.</p>
